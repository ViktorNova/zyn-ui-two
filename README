Misc UI Draw/Layout Routines For Replacement UI of ZynAddSubFX.
This code assumes an OpenGL 2.0 Compatiable Device and it makes use of nanovg
for virtually all drawing.
Once the Draw/Layout Routines are pretty much all functional, the actual logic
of the UI will likely end up implemented in QML, though nothing is set in stone.
Any contributions are very much appreciated.
