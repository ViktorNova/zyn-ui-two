Replacement user interface for ZynAddSubFX

Technology
----------

- Custom nanovg (opengl 2.0) based rendering
- Custom constraint based layout
- QML based structure/event handling

Progress
--------

As of so far a whole bunch of widget rendering code has been written.
A basic horizontal weighted/constrained pack layout has been created (in C)
and two simpler pack algorithms have been made in qml.
QML/nanovg integration has been establed and it appears to be relatively bug
free (though perhaps somewhat inefficient).
Some mouse handling has been done.
A variety of other widgets have received their design on paper.
To test some UI performance/integration a simple equalizer or envelop app might
be created.

Any contributions are very much appreciated.
